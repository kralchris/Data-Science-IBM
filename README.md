<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to my Capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! This project is the culmination of my learning journey throughout the certification, where I have gained valuable skills and knowledge in various data science techniques and tools.</p>

<p>In this project, I have applied the concepts and techniques learned to solve a real-world problem. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization, I have aimed to provide meaningful insights and create a valuable solution.</p>

<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers leave a company's services or products. By identifying the factors that contribute to churn and building a predictive model, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I have followed a structured approach that involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data understanding and preprocessing</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
  <li>Feature selection and engineering</li>
  <li>Model development and evaluation</li>
  <li>Deployment and visualization of results</li>
</ol>

<p>The project code and documentation can be found in the <code>src</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>To run the project locally, please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:</p>
